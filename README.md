# BookList
The purpose of this project is to learn more about how to store and display a list of objects in the form of a scrollable list. In this project, we will create the book display part of a book reader system. On the first page, you will see a list of books like below:

 <img src="https://github.com/MahdiTheGreat/BookList/assets/47212121/57503280-e667-4020-bed8-a2655b534e33" width="200" height="300"> 

This includes the book cover image, book title, and author name. For this page, the user can see the list in the form of a list in which the books are displayed below each other, or in such a way that there are 3 books next to each other in each line. The first mode was seen above so below we show the second mode:

The user can click on the book image to see more information about the book. In this case, another page should be displayed, in which the image of the book is displayed first, and below it, information about the book such as author, publisher, year of publication, edition, summary, etc. is displayed like below:

![BookDetails](https://github.com/MahdiTheGreat/BookList/assets/47212121/f4a69711-e676-4086-9830-8d38675f363d)

For this project, we store the information about five books.
